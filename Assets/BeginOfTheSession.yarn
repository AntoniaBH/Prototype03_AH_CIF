title: BeginOfTheSession
---
The room falls quiet as the client shifts in their chair, glancing around nervously. You sit back for a moment, picking up your notepad and pen.
Inner Thoughts: This is where the real work begins. The client has already shown courage in coming this far. My role now is to guide them—gently, steadily—into the heart of their Mindscape. Before we begin, I need to ensure they understand the tools at their disposal and how this process can help them find clarity.
You jot down brief notes, summarizing the key points from your conversation so far. The client’s posture has eased slightly, though their fingers still fidget with the hem of their sleeve.
You glance up, meeting their gaze with a calm and reassuring tone.
You: "I’d like to take a moment to explain the approach we’ll be using during our sessions. It’s a bit different from traditional talk therapy, but I think you’ll find it helpful. Let me start with the concept of the <b>Mindscape</b>."
You continue, voice steady and empathetic.
You: "The Mindscape is a way for us to explore your inner world. Think of it as a reflection of your thoughts, memories, and emotions—organized into spaces that we can visit and better understand together."
The client raises an eyebrow, their curiosity piqued despite a lingering trace of skepticism.
Client: "So... like my mind is a map or something?"
You nod, smiling slightly.
You: "Exactly. Each <b>Memory Space</b> represents a segment of your life or an experience that has shaped you. We’ll explore these spaces together, and they’ll help us understand what’s been bothering you beneath the surface."
You shift your tone to something softer, more grounding.
You: "As we explore, it’s normal to feel overwhelmed at times. That’s where the <b>Safe Space</b> comes in. It’s a personal sanctuary—a mental refuge where you can go to feel calm and grounded. Think of it as a tool to help manage any anxiety or discomfort during this process."
The client tilts their head, their hands now resting on their lap.
Client: "How does that work? Do I just... imagine a place?"
You lean forward slightly, maintaining an encouraging tone.
You: "Exactly. It’s a place that feels comforting to you—maybe somewhere from your past, or something entirely imagined. When you feel triggered or anxious, we’ll pause and guide you there. It’s a way to help you regain control and continue the process at your own pace."
You let the explanation settle for a moment before continuing.
You: "The combination of these methods allows us to dig deeper into what’s really bothering you while keeping you supported. As we explore your memories, we’ll begin to identify patterns and events that might be contributing to your current challenges. At the same time, the Safe Space ensures we’re always prioritizing your well-being."
The client nods slowly, their shoulders loosening a little more.
Client: "Okay... I think I get it. It sounds intense, but... maybe it could help me figure things out."
You meet their cautious optimism with reassurance.
You: "Do not forget, you’re in control every step of the way. We’ll go at a pace that feels right for you, and if something feels too difficult, we’ll adjust it immediatly."
Inner Thoughts: They’re beginning to open up to the process. The next step is taking that first journey into their Mindscape, identifying an entry point into their story. Each step forward builds on the trust we’ve established, reinforcing their sense of safety and autonomy.
You set down your notepad, letting the silence stretch for just a moment longer.
You: “Let’s start by grounding ourselves. I want you to take a deep breath and focus on the idea of the Mindscape. It’s not something you have to force—it’ll form naturally as we begin to explore your thoughts and feelings.”
You notice the client’s breathing hitch slightly before they exhale. Their fingers have stopped fidgeting now, resting loosely on their lap. You offer a small nod of encouragement.
You: “The first step in creating your Mindscape is to imagine a doorway. This doorway is your entry point—a connection between your conscious mind and the deeper parts of yourself. It can look like anything you want—a door, a gate, even a path. Whatever feels right to you.”
The client tilts their head slightly, their eyes narrowing in thought. They seem hesitant but curious
Client: “A doorway, huh? I guess... maybe it could look like the one to my childhood home? It’s the first thing that came to mind.”
You feel a flicker of recognition in their choice—a potential anchor to an important part of their story,
You: “That’s perfect. It doesn’t need to be anything complicated. Just something that feels familiar and grounding to you. Now, when you picture that doorway, I want you to think of it as the start of our journey. On the other side is the Mindscape, where your memories and experiences live.”
You pause, gauging their reaction. Their lips press together, but they nod faintly
You: “Let’s take it one step further. Once you pass through that doorway, the first thing you’ll encounter is your Safe Space. This is your sanctuary—a place where you feel completely at ease. It can be anywhere: a forest, a room, a beach, or even something abstract, like floating in warm light. Do you have a place in mind?”
The client looks down, their brow furrowing slightly. After a moment, they speak.
Client: “Maybe... a little cabin by a lake. I used to go camping there with my dad. It was always so quiet, so peaceful.”
You sense the shift in their tone—a softening, a hint of warmth in their words.
You: “That sounds like a wonderful Safe Space. Whenever we encounter something overwhelming, we’ll pause and guide you back there. It’s your space, and you can return to it anytime you need to feel grounded.”
The client’s shoulders relax further, the tension easing from their frame. 
You smile gently.
You: “Let’s visualize this together now. Close your eyes, if you’re comfortable. Picture the doorway—your childhood home—and step through. Let the Safe Space form around you. Feel the quiet, the peace of the lake and cabin. Let it fill you, like a warm embrace.”
For a moment, the room is quiet except for the soft sound of their breathing. The client’s face softens, their brow unfurrowing. After a few moments, they open their eyes.
Client: “I think I can see it. It’s... clearer than I expected.”
You: “That’s wonderful. Now that we’ve established your Safe Space, we’re ready to take our first steps into the Mindscape. We’ll start small—exploring one memory space at a time. Remember, you’re in control, and we’ll pause whenever you need.”
You lean back slightly, letting your words settle. The client’s expression is a mix of apprehension and quiet determination.

Inner Thoughts: This is the beginning of their journey—a delicate but vital step forward. The Safe Space is their anchor, and the Mindscape will be their path. Now it’s time to help them take that first step into understanding themselves.

		The client takes a deep breath, their body visibly relaxing as they nod.

		Client: “So, I’ve been feeling really anxious lately, especially when I try to drive again. It’s like... my chest tightens up, and I can’t breathe.”
		They grip their armrest momentarily before letting it go, their hands moving to rest on their lap. They meet your eyes tentatively, as though testing your reaction.
		Inner Thoughts: They’re opening up more easily now. Grounding techniques can help them regulate these physical symptoms of anxiety. This is a good opportunity to introduce a calming exercise.
		You: “That sounds overwhelming, but I’m glad you’re sharing this with me. Would it help if we worked on some breathing techniques together next time to ease those moments?”

		The client sits quietly for a moment, their expression conflicted. Eventually, they speak, their voice hesitant but clear.
		Client: “I don’t know. It’s hard to even think about what to say. But... there’s this feeling I can’t shake. Like I’m stuck in a loop, replaying the accident over and over.”
		Inner Thoughts: This is a significant step forward. Even sharing that they feel stuck indicates they’re starting to confront the experience, even if it’s painful.
		You: “It’s okay to feel uncertain—it’s part of the process. Together, we’ll work on finding a way out of that loop.”

		Client: “It feels like... my heart races, and my thoughts spin out of control. I can’t focus. It’s like I’m reliving something but don’t know what it is.”
		They rub their hands together nervously, as though trying to shake off the sensation.
		Inner Thoughts: This is a critical moment. They’re describing a panic response. I can use this opening to help them identify patterns and triggers.
		You: “That sounds overwhelming. It’s good that you’re starting to notice these patterns. Recognizing them is the first step to understanding them.”

		They glance at you briefly before looking down, their hands fidgeting with the hem of their sleeve.
		Inner Thoughts: They’re beginning to open up, but their understanding of the experience is still surface-level. I’ll need to help them explore this further.

		Client: “I was driving home. It had been a rough day at work, and... I don’t know. I was distracted. I remember looking at my phone, just for a second, and then… the sound of the crash.”
		Their voice cracks slightly, and they rub their temples, clearly struggling to keep their emotions in check.

		Client: “I remember… I was in the car. It had been a long day, and I wasn’t paying attention. There was this… this loud noise, and then everything went black.”
		They take a deep breath, gripping their knees tightly as they speak.
		Inner Thoughts: They’re starting to open up, though the details are still vague. I’ll need to tread carefully to help them recall more without increasing their distress.

		The client pauses, their eyes glistening as they look down at their hands. They exhale deeply before speaking.
		Client: “I just… I couldn’t handle it. The pain, the nightmares, the memories. The pills made it all... quieter. For a little while, at least.”
		They squeeze their hands into fists, as if bracing against the emotional weight of their words.
		Inner Thoughts: This is the first step toward acknowledgment. Empathy helps them feel seen, which can create the trust we need to explore their choices further.

		Client: “It just… it helped me get through the day. I didn’t know what else to do.”
		They glance at you cautiously, their shoulders slightly hunched as if waiting for judgment.

		After a moment, they take a deep breath and speak softly.
		Client: “There’s this intersection near my house. Every time I pass by, I feel like I can’t breathe. It’s like I’m back there, hearing the screech of tires, feeling that impact again.”
		Their hands start trembling, and they grip the edge of the chair tightly.

		Their voice cracks slightly, and they quickly look away, fidgeting with the hem of their sleeve.

Client: “I don’t think I can do this right now. Maybe next time.”
They shift uncomfortably, clearly wanting to change the subject.
Inner Thoughts: Pushing now might backfire. They’re not ready to open up yet. I need to approach this more gradually.
