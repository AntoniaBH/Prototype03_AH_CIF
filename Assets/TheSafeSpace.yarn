The client sits quietly, their eyes soft as they picture the sanctuary they’ve created in their mind.
You: “Let’s take a moment to step back into that cabin by the lake. Can you describe what it looks like as you walk up to it?”
Client: “It’s small, but cozy. The wood is a deep, warm brown, and there’s a porch with two chairs. I can see the lake just beyond it, glistening in the sunlight.”
You: “It sounds like a peaceful place. As you stand there, what do you notice about the air around you?”
Client: “It’s fresh, with a hint of pine. There’s a cool breeze, but it’s not too cold—it’s just right.”
You: “Good. Breathe in that fresh air for a moment. Let it fill you. Now, as you step closer to the cabin, what feelings come to mind?”
Client: “I feel... calm. Like nothing can reach me here. It’s safe.”

The client’s expression softens as they immerse themselves in the scene. 
You: “Let’s step inside the cabin now. What do you see as you open the door?”
Client:  “There’s a fireplace, with logs stacked neatly beside it. The flames are small but steady. The light flickers on the walls, and there’s a soft rug in the middle of the room.”
You: “It sounds warm and inviting. How does it feel to sit there by the fire?”
The client smiles softly.
Client: “It feels like a hug. The heat from the fire, the soft rug under my feet... it’s comforting. I can almost hear the crackling of the wood.”
You: “As you sit in this space, what emotions come up for you?”
Client: “I feel... lighter. Like all the tension in my chest is easing. It reminds me of when I was a kid, just being carefree for a little while.”
You:  “That’s wonderful. Hold onto that feeling for a moment. If you think about the challenges you’re facing now, how does being in this space help you?”
Client: “It makes everything feel less heavy. Like, even if things get tough, I know I can come back here and just... breathe.”
You:  “You’ve created a beautiful sanctuary for yourself. Remember, it’s always there for you. Anytime you feel overwhelmed, you can pause and step into this space, even if it’s just for a moment. Does that feel like something you can do?”
Client: “Yeah, I think so. It’s like having a place that’s just mine, where nothing can touch me.”
You: “Exactly. And the best part is, you’re the one in control of it. You can add to it, change it, or visit whenever you need to. It’s always within reach.”
You: “When you’re ready, take a deep breath and let the scene fade for now. Open your eyes, knowing that your Safe Space is still there, waiting for you whenever you need it.”
The client exhales slowly, their posture noticeably more relaxed. They glance up with a hint of a smile, their anxiety visibly eased.
You: “Good. Let’s continue from here, carrying that sense of peace with us as we move forward.”
