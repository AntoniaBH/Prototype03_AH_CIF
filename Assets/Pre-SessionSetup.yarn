The secretary gestures for the client to step inside.
The figure in the doorway is hesitant, their movements stiff with unease. Their eyes dart around the room before settling on you. You rise, extending a warm greeting.
You: "Hello, It is nice to meet you. Please, take a seat."
The client nods and walks to the chair opposite your desk, sitting down slowly. Their hands rest awkwardly in their lap, their shoulders hunched as if bracing for something.
The air hangs heavy for a moment. Then, you glance at your notes, silently rehearsing the sessions structure in your mind.
Inner Thoughts: Who are they? Why are they here? What is it they are running from—or toward?
The session is about to begin.
You lower yourself back into your chair, adjusting its position slightly. The familiar creak of the leather cushion accompanies you as you reach for the clipboard on your desk.
The smooth, cool surface of the clipboard meets your fingers as you lift it. On its face, a concise summary of the person sitting across from you.
*clipboard pops-up*
Inner Thoughts: A life encapsulated in bullet points. Yet, the depths of their struggles remain unwritten here.
You glance up briefly, meeting the client’s anxious gaze. Their fingers twist together in their lap, a subtle indicator of tension. You return your attention to the clipboard, committing the essentials to memory before setting it aside.
*clipboard pops-up again with a different page*
As you return your focus to the present, the client watches you expectantly, their posture slightly more rigid now. You offer a reassuring smile before introducing yourself.
You: "I want to start by saying how much I appreciate you taking this first step. This space is yours to share whatever feels right. Let’s take it at your pace."
The client nods, though their shoulders remain tight. You lean forward slightly, softening your tone.

Inner Thoughts: The first step is always delicate—like testing the temperature of water before diving in. I need to gauge where they are emotionally, but not in a way that feels intrusive. A misstep here could make them feel exposed, and that’s the last thing I want.
Inner Thoughts: Time to open the door, just a little, and see what they’re ready to share.
->Emotional Assessment.
	You: “Can you describe how you've been feeling recently, maybe some specific moments or situations that triggered these feelings?”
	The client hesitates, glancing at their hands.
	Client: "It’s… been hard. Some days, it feels like I’m just going through the motions. But then, out of nowhere, it hits me—this weight I can’t shake off."
	Inner Thoughts: They’re clearly overwhelmed but struggling to articulate the specifics. This might require more focused questions later to uncover those trigger points

->Mental State Check.
	You: “I know this must be tough. How have you been feeling lately? Anything that’s been weighing heavily on your mind?”
	The client exhales shakily, their voice trembling.
	Client: "I just… feel stuck. Like I’m trying to climb out of this hole, but the walls are too steep. And every time I think I’ve found a foothold, I slip"
	Inner Thoughts: A vivid metaphor. They’re trapped in their struggle, but metaphors can be a bridge to deeper understanding. Building trust will help us explore this further

->Emotional and Physical Assessment.
	You:"Can you describe how you’ve been feeling physically and emotionally?"
	Client: "Physically? I… don’t think about that much. I mean, I guess I’ve been tired. Always tired. And emotionally… I feel like I’m on autopilot. Numb, mostly"
	Inner Thoughts: That disconnect between physical and emotional awareness might be part of the problem. It’s worth revisiting later to help them reconnect with their body.

	The client blinks, uncertain at first, but follows your lead as you inhale and exhale deeply. Their shoulders visibly relax after a moment of silence.
	Client: "That… helps, I think. I don’t know why, but it does.

	You:"I hear you’ve been under stress. Let’s dive into that a bit more."
	The client’s lips press into a thin line as they pause.
	Client: "Stress doesn’t even begin to cover it. It’s like I’m carrying a boulder, and no matter what I do, I can’t put it down."
	Inner Thoughts: They’re expressing their stress vividly. This imagery might be useful to explore their coping mechanisms or the root cause.

	You: “It’s important to get an accurate picture of how you’ve been managing. Can you think of any patterns or events that might have contributed to how you feel today?”
	The client frowns, their brow furrowing as they think.
	Client: "Patterns? I guess… I keep coming back to the same thing. Every time something gets too hard, I just… shut down or reach for something to numb it. It’s like a cycle I can’t break."
	Inner Thoughts: This is a significant admission. Their awareness of the cycle is a valuable starting point—we can use this as a foundation for understanding and change.

Studying the client briefly you notice the subtle tremor in their fingers, the way their gaze flickers between the floor and the window. They’re nervous, guarded. It’s a posture you’ve seen before; a body that speaks of burdens, even when the mouth won’t.
Your hand hovers over the clipboard, but you resist the urge to write just yet. First impressions aren’t made on paper—they’re forged in the quiet moments between words.
Inner Thoughts: This is the first step. They’re here, and that’s something. But if I rush, if I push too hard, I risk losing them before we even begin. The tone I set now will shape this entire process.
->Atmosphere Calibration.
	You: “Before we dive into the session, I’d like to ask, are there any boundaries or things you’d prefer to avoid talking about today?”
	The client pauses, fidgeting slightly.
	Client: "I… I think I’d rather not talk about my family right now. It’s just… too much."
	You nod thoughtfully and jot a quick note on your clipboard.
	Inner Thoughts: The hesitation is telling. Their family may be a significant source of pain—or a wall they’re not ready to climb just yet. I’ll respect that boundary but keep it in mind for later sessions.
	You give a reassuring nod and write a note on your clipboard.

	The client blinks, their tense posture softening slightly.
	Client: "Thanks… I think I need to hear that. I guess I’ve always felt like I had to say what people wanted to hear, you know?"
	You offer a small smile and adjust yourself in your seat, leaning slightly forward.
	Inner Thoughts: Reassuring them of control was the right step. It’s clear they’ve been conditioned to suppress their true feelings. We’ll need to work on breaking that pattern.

	You: “You seem a bit nervous. Would you like a moment to adjust or something to help you feel more at ease?”
	The client looks at you with a flicker of surprise before nodding slowly.
	Client: "Maybe… just a second. This is a bit overwhelming."
	You lean back, giving them space, and quietly adjust the position of your clipboard to avoid drawing attention to their unease.
	Inner Thoughts: Their nerves are understandable—this is a vulnerable step for anyone. Small gestures of understanding can make all the difference in building trust.

	You: "This is a safe space for you. We’ll take it one step at a time."
	The client lets out a breath they didn’t seem to realize they were holding.
	Client: "Safe space… I guess I haven’t had one of those in a long time."
	You press your pen against the paper but refrain from writing, keeping your full attention on the client.
	Inner Thoughts: That sigh was loaded with unspoken history. They’re carrying more than they’re ready to share, but acknowledging the lack of safety is a step toward reclaiming it.

	The client tilts their head, as though weighing your words.
	Client: "Together… I like that. I’m tired of feeling like I have to handle everything on my own."
	You shift in your chair slightly, mirroring their posture to create a sense of rapport.
	Inner Thoughts: Acknowledging their need for collaboration validates their struggle. Framing therapy as a partnership might help them feel less isolated.

	The client bites their lip, then nods with a faint smile.
	Client: "That sounds good. I think… I just need to feel like I’m not drowning anymore."
	You write a quick note, underlining the word drowning twice.
	Inner Thoughts: They’re signaling that they’re overwhelmed—perhaps even desperate. Anchoring the session around this immediate need might help create a foothold for progress

You clear your throat gently, offering a small, reassuring smile.
Inner Thoughts: They’re settling in, but there’s still hesitation—a quiet resistance lingering beneath the surface. It’s not unusual. Vulnerability doesn’t come easy, especially when you’ve spent years building walls to survive.
The clipboard rest in your hand while you tap your pen lighty against the page as you consider your next words.
Inner Thoughts: What drives them? What brought them here, beyond the immediate pain? Unspoken aspirations lie behind even the darkest struggles. I need to help them find those.
You take a breath, raising your eyes to meet theirs.
->Aspirational Discovery.
	You: “Let’s get clear on what you want to achieve. Are there any specific changes you’re hoping to see in your life after therapy?”
	The client hesitates, their gaze falling to their lap. Their fingers fidget nervously before they speak.
	Client: "I... I just want to feel normal again. Like I can get through a day without needing to rely on something to take the edge off."
	They look up, their expression both vulnerable and determined.
	Inner Thoughts: A glimpse of clarity, even in their hesitation. That longing for 'normal'—a word so heavy, so subjective. It’s a fragile but promising starting point.

	The client leans back slightly, their shoulders sagging.
	Client: "I don’t even know where to start. I guess... figuring out why I keep messing things up. Why it feels like I can’t stop."
	Their voice grows quieter toward the end, trailing off into an uneasy silence.
	Inner Thoughts: Uncertainty can be a sign of exhaustion, but also of reflection. They’re searching, and that’s enough for now. I can help them focus.

	Client: "Maybe. If we could just figure out why I keep... feeling this way? Then maybe the rest would start to make sense."
	Their voice gains strength as they speak, as though articulating their thoughts brings relief.

	Client: "Important? I don’t know. I mean, everything feels important... but nothing does at the same time. Does that make sense?"
	They slump forward slightly, their hands gripping their knees.
	Inner Thoughts: Ambivalence. A common but telling state of mind. The conflict between urgency and emptiness—it’s a window into their struggles.
	You: "Yes, yes it does."
	With a nod and a small smile, you show the client, reassuring him.

	Their voice wavers slightly but carries a trace of relief, as though admitting this out loud lightened their burden.

	Client: "Patterns? I... I guess I keep running away. From people, from problems. It’s like I can’t let myself stay in one place for too long."
	Their hands rest still in their lap for the first time, their breathing slowing.

Inner Thoughts: The first step isn’t about finding solutions. It’s about showing them they can be safe here, even if it’s uncomfortable at first.
The room is quiet, the faint hum of the air conditioning filling the space. You lean back slightly in your chair, studying the client. They sit across from you, their body tense but their expression blank.
Inner Thoughts: How do I help them open up? It's too early to dive into deep waters, but the surface tension is unmistakable. A subtle nudge, a carefully chosen question—that's all it takes to guide the conversation.
You shift forward, offering a reassuring smile before speaking.
->Urgency Evaluation.
	You: “What’s been the hardest part for you recently? Can you think of any situations or events that have escalated your challenges?”
	The client furrows their brow, their hands tightening on the arms of the chair.
	Client: "There was... this argument with my sister. She doesn’t understand what I’m going through, and it just makes everything worse."
	Their voice cracks slightly, and they glance away, their frustration evident.
	Inner Thoughts: A moment of vulnerability. The argument is just the tip of the iceberg—it’s the emotions beneath it that matter. Anger, guilt, loneliness? That’s where the work begins.

	The client looks up at you, their eyes wide with surprise. After a pause, they speak softly.
	Client: "It’s not urgent, I guess, but... it’s hard to shake this feeling that I’m just stuck. Like no matter what I do, nothing’s going to change."
	Their voice cracks slightly, and they wipe at their eyes quickly, as though embarrassed by their vulnerability.

	Client: "I—I don’t know. Maybe? I just... don’t want to sound stupid or like I’m overreacting. I hate feeling like this, like I can’t handle my own problems."	
	Their hands grip the fabric of their pants tightly.

You consider your next approach, knowing that how you connect now will be important for the session.

	You: “Tell me about how you typically react when things get tough. What kind of support do you usually turn to in difficult times?”
	The client tilts their head, considering the question. They clasp their hands in their lap, their fingers fidgeting.
